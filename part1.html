        <h1>Academic Conference</h1>

        <h4>First time attending an academic conference?<br> 
         Don’t sweat it, read on to ease your initiation.</h4>
        <p>An academic conference (sometimes called a research conference, academic congress, academic meeting or symposium)<br> 
        is a meeting which researchers attend to present their findings and hear about the latest work within their field. <br>
        These events are usually organised by associations or groups of independent researchers under the watchful eye of a <br>
        scientific or technical committee who ensure the technical quality of the research that’s presented.<br> <br> 

        Academic conferences aren’t just for academics and they come in all shapes and sizes, from small local meetings to <br>
        global events with thousands of international attendees. And while some conferences focus on highly-specialised topics <br>
        within a single discipline, interdisciplinary conferences often bring together a broad variety of perspectives from <br>
        academics, the industry and practitioners across several disciplines. </p>
